Hello! I'm a geographer (2012) with a Master of Science in Remote Sensing (INPE, 2017), currently focused on studying and applying cutting-edge technologies in geospatial data and climate risk modeling. My expertise spans Python programming, Earth observation using tools like Google Earth Engine, and leveraging AI for geo-analytics.

I'm passionate about exploring advancements in geospatial data automation, machine learning for environmental applications, and integrating insurance insights with geospatial analytics. I am currently refining my skills in time series analysis, ML/AI, geostatistics, MLops, PostGIS and WebMaps applications
